# Favorite Fonts Project

This app was created as a way for me to work on my CSS skills and also serves as my pre-work project for the 14th Chingu Voyage. (what is Chingu all about? read more here : http://chingu.io)

A LIVE demonstration of the app can be found at https://jacob-andersen.github.io/FavoriteFontsProject/ 

<h1>Features</h1>

The app makes it possible to compare text written in 8 different Fonts arranged in a grid of font cards.

The Text and Font Size can be changed, using a custom text box and a font size chooser.

The text changes in real time in all 8 font cards as you type, and the app presently allows for choosing between 4 different font sizes.

When there is no text in the custom text box, the standard sample text is displayed. 

Changing the font size will immediately be reflected in all font cards.

The text and font size can always be reset to the original settings by clicking the <img src=
"assets/reset.png" height="25px" width="25px"> button.

<h1>Features yet to be implemented</h1>

<li>Some of the buttons are presently just for show, and don't actually do anything.

<li>The links on the navigation bar at the top of the screen are not going anywhere.

<li>The Google Search, Contrast and Grid/List icons are also not wired up to any functionality.

<li>A back-to-top-button would come in handy, when the combination of much text and a large font size causes the navigation bar to scroll out of view.

<li> The layout of the page is not as responsive as it could be, in regards to different screeen sizes.
